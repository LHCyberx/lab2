Lab 2: Git / GitHub / Contribution

GitHub is a well-known and very helpful open-source repository that is meant for people to collaborate and review different lines of code and files. One of the features processes within GitHub is known as a Pull Request. A Pull Request is a method of submitting contributions, or suggested edits, to an open-source project; a project that might be on GitHub. Within this post, I have included a tutorial on how to create a Pull Request in the GitHub UI. This article proves to be a great step-by-step guide for a user to create a Pull Request. For this post, I show how a simple example of a Commit Change & Pull Request combination on a file for IST 402. When committing a change to a file, this file must first be forked, or “cloned”, into your personal repository. Then the edits can be made to the file; making sure to fill out a “Commit Change” towards the bottom outlining what changes were made to the file. After this is confirmed, a Pull Request must be submitted to the original file, or the suggested changes will not be made to the original master file. By going under the Pull Request tab on GitHub and creating a new pull request pointed towards the original “unedited” file, you are submitting a suggestion to the owner of the file that these changes should be made to improve the quality of the file. This is just one of many features that GitHub has to offer, as it has quickly become one of the most-used open-source project platforms in the IT community.
